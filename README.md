This is a full-stack application that allows users to upload images to a hosted Mongo Database.  

## technology - what I used

Front-end: React, Tailwind

Back-end: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Axios, Multer

## technology - why I used it

I chose React for the front-end due to its efficient component-based architecture and strong community support, which allows for rapid development and easy maintenance. Tailwind CSS was selected for its utility-first approach, enabling me to create responsive, modern designs with minimal custom CSS. For the back-end, Node.js and Express.js provide a fast and scalable server environment, while MongoDB with Mongoose offers a flexible and efficient NoSQL database solution, and Axios and Multer facilitate seamless data fetching and file uploads.
